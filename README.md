Headless chatbot that detects spam and posts it to chatrooms. Uses [ChatExchange](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange), takes questions from the Stack Exchange [realtime tab](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime), and accesses answers via the [Stack Exchange API](http://api.stackexchange.com/).

Example [chat post](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/11540?m=17962164#17962164):

User documentation is in the [wiki](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey).

To set up, use

```
git config user.email "smokey@erwaysoftware.com"
git config user.name "SmokeDetector"

git clone https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.git
cd SmokeDetector
git checkout deploy
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
pip3 install --user -r user_requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Next, copy `config.sample` to a new file called `config`, and edit the values required.

To run, use `python3 nocrash.py` (preferably in a daemon-able mode, like a `screen` session.)
You can also use `python3 ws.py`, but then SmokeDetector will be shut down after 6 hours; when running from `nocrash.py`, it will be restarted. (This is to be sure that closed websockets, if any, are reopened)

You can run `. ChatExchange/setp.sh` to set local environment variables so that you don't have to log in every time.

SmokeDetector only supports Stack Exchange OpenIDs for now.
