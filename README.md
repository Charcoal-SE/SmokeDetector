Headless chatbot that detects spam and posts it to chatrooms.
Uses [ChatExchange](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange),
takes questions from the Stack Exchange
[realtime tab](https://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime),
and accesses answers via the [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/).

## Documentation

User documentation is in the [wiki](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey).

Detailed documentation for
[setting up and running SmokeDetector is in the wiki](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey/Set-Up-and-Run-SmokeDetector).

### Basic setup

To set up SmokeDetector, please use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.git
cd SmokeDetector
git checkout deploy
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
pip3 install --user -r user_requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Next, copy `config.sample` to a new file called `config`,
and edit the values required.

To run, use `python3 nocrash.py`
(preferably in a daemon-able mode, like a `screen` session.)
You can also use `python3 ws.py`,
but then SmokeDetector will be shut down after 6 hours;
when running from `nocrash.py`, it will be restarted.
(This is to be sure that closed websockets, if any, are reopened.)

### Virtual environment setup

Running in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
is a good way to isolate dependency packages from your local system.
To set up SmokeDetector in a virtual environment, you can use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector.git
cd SmokeDetector
git config user.email "smokey@erwaysoftware.com"
git config user.name "SmokeDetector"
git checkout deploy

python3 -m venv env
env/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
env/bin/pip3 install --user -r user_requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Next, copy the config file and edit as said above.
To run SmokeDetector in this virtual environment, use
`env/bin/python3 nocrash.py`.

[Note: On some systems (e.g. Mac's and Linux), some circumstances may
require the `--user` option to be removed from the last `pip3`
command line in the above instructions. However, the `--user` option is
known to be necessary in other circumstances. Further testing is
necessary to resolve the discrepancy.]

### Docker setup

Running in a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
is an even better way to isolate dependency packages from your local system.
To set up SmokeDetector in a Docker container, follow the steps below.

1. Grab the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and build an image of SmokeDetector:

   ```shell
   DATE=$(date +%F)
   mkdir temp
   cd temp
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/master/Dockerfile
   docker build -t smokey:$DATE .
   ```

2. Create a container from the image you just built

   ```shell
   docker create --name=mysmokedetector smokey:$DATE
   ```

3. Start the container.
   Don't worry, SmokeDetector won't run until it's ready,
   so you have the chance to edit the configuration file before SmokeDetector runs.

   Copy `config.sample` to a new file named `config`
   and edit the values required,
   then copy the file into the container with this command:

   ```shell
   docker cp config mysmokedetector:/home/smokey/SmokeDetector/config
   ```

4. If you would like to set up additional stuff (SSH, Git etc.),
   you can do so with a Bash shell in the container:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it mysmokedetector bash
   ```

   After you're ready, put a file named `ready` under `/home/smokey`:

   ```shell
   touch ~smokey/ready
   ```

#### Automate Docker deployment with Docker Compose

I'll assume you have the basic ideas of Docker and Docker Compose.

The first thing you need is a properly filled `config` file.
You can start with [the sample](config.sample).

Create a directory (name it whatever you like),
place the `config` file and [`docker-compose.yml` file](docker-compose.yml).
Run `docker-compose up -d` and your SmokeDetector instance is up.

If you want additional control like memory and CPU constraint,
you can edit `docker-compose.yml` and add the following keys to `smokey`.
The example values are recommended values.

```yaml
restart: always  # when your host reboots Smokey can autostart
mem_limit: 512M
cpus: 0.5  # Recommend 2.0 or more for spam waves
```

## Requirements

SmokeDetector only supports Stack Exchange logins.

SmokeDetector supports the Python versions which are in the [supported phase of the Python life cycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) (as defined as between "First release" and "End of life"). We run CI testing on that span of versions. SmokeDetector may work on older versions of Python, but we don't support them and may, at any time, write code that prevents use in older, unsupported versions. We know SmokeDetector is broken on Python 3.6 and lower. While we don't support versions that haven't reached "First release", we're not adverse to hearing about changes in new Python versions which will require us to make changes to SmokeDetector's code, so we can make the transition to supporting new versions of Python smoother.

To allow committing blacklist and watchlist modifications
back to GitHub,
your system also needs Git 1.8 or higher,
although we recommend Git 2.11+.
