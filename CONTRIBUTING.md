New contributors are always welcome to Charcoal projects. Contributions to Charcoal can come in a number of ways, and are not limited to
code contributions. You could also:

 - write documentation
 - [feed back](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey/Feedback-Guidance) on spam detections in
   [Charcoal HQ](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540)
 - [review](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/review/posts) old spam detections
 - help [maintain our blacklists](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey/Privileges#code-admin-aka-blacklister-ms)
 
For most of our projects, your best bet is to drop in to [Charcoal HQ](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540) first, and talk to the
people in there - that's our center of operations, and we'll be happy to point you in the right direction for what you're interested in
doing.

**If you'd like to contribute code**, awesome! The above still applies - the helpful folks in CHQ will guide you. In general, feel free to
pick an issue that's not too controversial and work on that - drop a comment on the issue so we know someone's doing it. In this project - 
SmokeDetector - tests _will_ need to pass before we can merge your pull request, though that doesn't apply for some of our other projects.

**If you're not familiar with Python** but you still want to code, that's cool too - we have a number of other projects which you may be
able to contribute to more easily:

 - [metasmoke](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke) is a Ruby on Rails web dashboard for SmokeDetector
 - we have a bunch of [userscripts](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/userscripts) that we use - those are in JavaScript
 
TL;DR: If you'd like to help out with Charcoal, drop into chat and we'll be able to find you something to do.

**If you are making a pull request for code changes** you must adhere to specific guidelines.  Please refer to the 
`CONTRIBUTING_PULLREQS.md` file for details on what we require in pull requests for code changes to properly review the request. Pull 
requests without these requirements may be rejected or require additional information from the original filer until we get details about 
the request
